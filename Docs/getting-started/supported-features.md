# Supported Features

[Aspose.SVG for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/svg/net/) is a powerful API for creating, editing, converting, and rendering SVG documents in .NET applications. It allows developers to programmatically generate SVG, manipulate the DOM, apply transforms, and convert SVG to formats such as PDF, PNG, JPG, TIFF, XPS, and SVGZ. The library supports advanced features, including vectorization, gradients, filters, path building, and SVG optimization, making it ideal for automating SVG workflows and high-quality graphics processing.

## Key Features

Aspose.SVG for .NET aims high at facilitating its users for working with SVG files. Key features supported by the API include:

- [SVG Creation and Loading](https://docs.aspose.com/svg/net/create-svg-document/): Create SVG documents from scratch, memory strings, streams, files, or URLs. Load SVG and SVGZ files synchronously or asynchronously, including external resources.
- [SVG Editing and DOM Manipulation](https://docs.aspose.com/svg/net/edit-svg-file/): Add and modify elements, shapes, paths, and attributes using DOM APIs, CSS selectors, and XPath queries.
- [Rendering and Conversion](https://docs.aspose.com/svg/net/convert-svg/): Convert SVG to PDF, XPS, SVGZ, and raster image formats (PNG, JPG, BMP, TIFF, GIF) with customizable rendering options.
- [Image Vectorization](https://docs.aspose.com/svg/net/vectorization/) and [SVG Optimization](https://docs.aspose.com/svg/net/how-to-optimize-svg/): Convert raster images and text into scalable vector paths, apply stenciling, and optimize SVG files by reducing size and complexity.
- Advanced SVG Features: Merge multiple SVGs, apply transformations, filters, gradients, and manage text, fonts, and glyphs programmatically.
- [SVG Builder API](https://docs.aspose.com/svg/net/svg-builder/): Use fluent builders for elements, paths, paints, strokes, and fills to efficiently construct complex SVG graphics.
- [Configuration and Logging](https://docs.aspose.com/svg/net/environment-configuration/): Customize runtime configuration and enable logging for network requests and error handling.

Aspose.SVG for .NET is designed for developers who need precise control over SVG graphics, reliable format conversion, and scalable vector processing in professional .NET environments.
